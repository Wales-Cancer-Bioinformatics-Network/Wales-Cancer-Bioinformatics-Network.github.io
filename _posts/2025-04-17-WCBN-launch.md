Following the 17th April Wales Cancer Bioinformatics Network meeting, we have now launched the WCBN site. Set up initially by ALex Gibbs, this resource will act as a repository for contacts, tutorials and articles on bioinformatics & cancer within the network. The presentation on the 17th April was by Dr. Nathan Harmston:

### Structural variation in anaplastic astrocytoma highlights therapeutic opportunities
 
Anaplastic astrocytoma is a form of brain tumour with a highly variable prognosis. Here, we have performed an indepth analysis of a small cohort (n=8) tumours and identified the patterns of structural variation. Following this we found two patients with whole-genome duplications and provide evidence that this may result in a subset of AA being sensitive to proteasome inhibition.
